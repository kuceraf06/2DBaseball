<h1>2D Baseball — Documentation (Docs/)</h1>

The Docs/ directory contains all technical documentation for the 2D Baseball project, including game algorithms, system architecture, development roadmaps, and detailed descriptions of core mechanics used in both the desktop (Electron) and web versions.

This folder is intended for developers, contributors, and anyone who wants to understand the internal workings of the game.

</br>
</br>
📚 Purpose of This Directory

The Docs/ section provides:

Complete explanations of gameplay algorithms

Technical breakdowns of systems (physics, AI, game loop, controls)

Roadmaps for future development

Architecture diagrams and internal logic

Notes for contributors and maintainers

It serves as the central reference point for the entire 2D Baseball system.

</br>
</br>
📄 Contents of Docs/

This directory typically includes the following categories:

<b>1. Roadmaps</b>

Long-term and short-term development plans, including:

Upcoming game features

Planned AI improvements

UI/UX updates

Web platform enhancements

Release milestones

Technical tasks and refactoring notes

These roadmaps help guide the project's future direction and maintain consistency in development.
</br>
</br>

<b>2. Gameplay Algorithms</b>

Detailed explanations of the logic powering the game, such as:

Pitching mechanics and pitch trajectories

Hitting detection and contact probability

Ball physics (velocity, drag, bounce, collision)

Stealing and pickoff timing algorithms

Inning and scoring logic

Error handling and randomization systems

Every gameplay feature is described with diagrams and step-by-step logic.
</br>
</br>

<b>3. AI Behavior</b>

Documentation related to the artificial opponent, including:

Decision-making logic

Situational awareness (score, inning, runners)

Pitch selection algorithms

Batting logic and swing timing

Difficulty scaling (if implemented)

This section explains how the AI adapts to real-time gameplay.
</br>
</br>

<b>4. System Architecture</b>

Technical descriptions of:

Game loop structure

Event handling

Input processing

Scene management

Asset loading

Interactions between web, desktop, and internal modules

Some documents may include flowcharts, class diagrams, or UML models.
</br>
</br>

<b>5. Function-Level Algorithms</b>

Breakdowns of specific in-game functions, for example:

Collision detection

Base-running logic

Scoreboard updates

Camera/viewport logic

Animation timing

Database queries (for the web version)

Each algorithm is described so it can be reproduced, debugged, or extended.

</br>
</br>
🧪 Usage (For Developers)

Developers should use the Docs/ directory to:

Understand internal systems before modifying code

Learn how specific mechanics work

Explore planned features and ongoing tasks

Maintain consistent logic across all modules

Contribute new features following established guidelines

This documentation ensures the game remains stable, scalable, and maintainable.
