<h1>2D Baseball Simulator</h1>

A 2D interactive baseball simulator that allows you to hit, pitch, throw pickoffs, steal bases, and compete against an AI opponent.</br>
</br>
📌 Repository Structure

This project is divided into three main directories:

<b>Docs/</b>

Documentation for internal algorithms, game logic, AI decision-making, and technical architecture.
Includes:

AI opponent behavior

Collision and ball-trajectory algorithms

Game loop design

Technical diagrams and system descriptions

<b>BaseballGame/</b>

The main desktop game — a full 2D baseball simulator.
Core features include:

⚾ Pitching (fastball, changeup, slider — depending on your implementation)

🏏 Hitting with realistic ball physics

👟 Stealing bases

🎯 Pickoff attempts

🤖 AI opponent reacting dynamically to game situations

🎮 Game UI, scoreboard, animations, and controls

<b>baseballWeb/</b>

The web component of the project, containing:

about a game

account details

guides/tutorials

leaderboard
</br>
</br>

🤖 AI Opponent

The AI system is designed to:

analyze base runners and game state

decide on steal attempts or pitching strategies

react to pitch types

adjust its behavior based on inning, score, and situation

Detailed descriptions of all algorithms are located in the Docs directory.
